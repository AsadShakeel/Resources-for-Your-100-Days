### How to contribute: :pencil:

1. Fork the open-source-for-beginners repo and create a new branch to work on.
2. Open resourcelist.md in your new branch in the forked repo.
3. Find the appropriate topic/language on existing the list, or add a new one.
4. Under the heading, add your resource (please include a link). It can be a video, a course, an article, a content creator... Anything! If it helped you, it could help others!
5. Commit your changes.
6. Create a pull request, and your contributions will be merged to the open-source-for-beginners repo. 
7. Delete the forked repo once you're done **or** keep the main branch up to date by fetching changes upstream from this repo, and create new pull requests each time you contribute.

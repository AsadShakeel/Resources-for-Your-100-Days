# Open Source For Beginners

### This is a repository compiling the best resources that 100daysofcode coders use. Our favourite courses, challenges and places to learn. 

### This repository is for all of us to start contributing to open source. We are often told how important it is to contribute, so I wanted to create a place where contributing is easy and low-stakes. Feel free to try things and make mistakes, and we will fix them together! 

## My goal is to pool the experiences of as many coders as possible, and create a list of resources for anyone to use to find new ways to learn. 

# How to contribute :pencil2:

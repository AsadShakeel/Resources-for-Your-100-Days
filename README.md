# Resources for Your 100 Days [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

## This is a repository compiling the best resources that 100daysofcode coders use. Our favourite courses, challenges and places to learn. 

This repository is for all of us to start contributing to open source. We are often told how important it is to contribute, so I wanted to create a place where contributing is easy and low-stakes. Feel free to try things and make mistakes, and we will fix them together! 

**My goal is to pool the experiences of as many coders as possible, and create a list of resources for anyone to use to find new ways to learn.**

# Code of Conduct :white_check_mark: 

I have started this project for beginners like me, and I want it to be a warm and safe space for coders to get their first open source contributions. 
Any off-topic/negative/derogatory content that is added to the list will be removed, and any pull requests that include abusive language will be closed without merging. 
If you see any comments that you would like to report, please message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rubyspch) and I will do what I can to sort it.
